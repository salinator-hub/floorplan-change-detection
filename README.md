# floorplan-change-detection
This GitHub repository contains a Python code for floor plan change detection. It analyzes two images (potentially converted from PDFs) to highlight layout changes (walls, doors) and potential room alterations (color analysis). The goal is to automate change detection and provide visual representation of modifications.
